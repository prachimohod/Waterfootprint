# Daily-Water-Calculator
This is a responsive web application that I built for users calculating their daily water intake. It helps someone calculate how much water they need to drink based on their weight and minutes of exercise. The calculator divides the user's weight in half and adds twelve ounces of water for every thirty minutes of exercise. It is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and made responsive by using the flexbox grid system. As you size the window down, you will see the paragraph text respond as well as the legend text for the fieldset. This is also optimized for smart phones and tablets using a media query.
